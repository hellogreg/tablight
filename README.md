# tablight
Tablight is a tiny, responsive, progressively-enhanced top tabs widget for displaying content panels. 

I made it because I needed a replacement for YUI's Tabview. I used YUI in an old version of our website at my job, but I'm going without third-party frameworks this time around.

On larger screens (e.g., desktop and tablets), top tab buttons are arranged in horizontal order. On small screens and browsers without JavaScript, top tabs default to a bulleted list with in-page anchor links.
